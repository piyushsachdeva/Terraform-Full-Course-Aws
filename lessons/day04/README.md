- S3 Native State Locking (No DynamoDB required)
- State management

## Key Learning Points

### How Terraform Updates Infrastructure
- **Goal**: Keep actual state same as desired state
- **State File**: Actual state resides in terraform.tfstate file
- **Process**: Terraform compares current state with desired configuration
- **Updates**: Only changes the resources that need modification

### Terraform State File
The state file is a JSON file that contains:
- Resource metadata and current configuration
- Resource dependencies
- Provider information
- Resource attribute values

### State File Best Practices
1. **Never edit state file manually**
2. **Store state file remotely** (not in local file system)
3. **Enable state locking** to prevent concurrent modifications
4. **Backup state files** regularly
5. **Use separate state files** for different environments
6. **Restrict access** to state files (contains sensitive data)
7. **Encrypt state files** at rest and in transit

### Remote Backend Benefits
- **Collaboration**: Team members can share state
- **Locking**: Prevents concurrent state modifications
- **Security**: Encrypted storage and access control
- **Backup**: Automatic versioning and backup
- **Durability**: Highly available storage

### AWS Remote Backend Components

- **S3 Bucket**: Stores the state file
- **S3 Native State Locking**: Uses S3 conditional writes for locking (introduced in Terraform 1.10)
- **IAM Policies**: Control access to backend resources

## S3 Native State Locking

### What is S3 Native State Locking?

Starting with **Terraform 1.10** (released in 2024), you no longer need DynamoDB for state locking. Terraform now supports **S3 native state locking** using Amazon S3's **Conditional Writes** feature.

### How It Works

S3 native state locking uses the **If-None-Match** HTTP header to implement atomic operations:

1. When Terraform needs to acquire a lock, it attempts to create a lock file in S3
2. S3 conditional writes check if the lock file already exists
3. If the lock file exists, the write operation fails, preventing concurrent modifications
4. If the lock file doesn't exist, it's created successfully and the lock is acquired
5. When the operation completes, the lock file is deleted (appears as a delete marker with versioning)


**Previous Method (DynamoDB):**
- Required separate DynamoDB table creation
- Additional AWS service to monitor and maintain
- More complex IAM permissions
- Extra cost for DynamoDB read/write operations
- DynamoDB state locking is now **discouraged** and may be deprecated in future Terraform versions



## Tasks for Practice

### Setup Remote Backend

#### Step 1: Create S3 Bucket for State Storage

Create an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled to store Terraform state files.You can use the test.sh script provided in the code folder to do it quickly using AWS CLI.



### Configuration Example

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key          = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    use_lockfile = true
    encrypt      = true
  }
}
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `bucket`: S3 bucket name for state storage
- `key`: Path within the bucket where state file will be stored
- `region`: AWS region for the S3 bucket
- `use_lockfile`: Enable S3 native state locking (set to `true`)
- `encrypt`: Enable server-side encryption for the state file



**Important:** S3 versioning MUST be enabled for S3 native state locking to work properly.



### How to Test State Locking

To verify that S3 native state locking is working:

1. **Terminal 1**: Run `terraform apply`
2. **Terminal 2**: While the first is running, try `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`
3. **Expected Result**: The second command should fail with an error like:
   ```
   Error: Error acquiring the state lock
   Error message: operation error S3: PutObject, https response error StatusCode: 412
   Lock Info:
     ID:        <lock-id>
     Path:      <bucket>/<key>
     Operation: OperationTypeApply
     Who:       <user>@<hostname>
   ```

4. **Check S3 Bucket**: During the operation, you'll see a `.tflock` file temporarily in your S3 bucket
5. **After Completion**: The lock file will be automatically deleted (delete marker with versioning)

### Backend Migration
```bash
# Initialize with new backend configuration
terraform init

# Terraform will prompt to migrate existing state
# Answer 'yes' to copy existing state to new backend

# Verify state is now remote
terraform state list
```

### State Commands
```bash
# List resources in state
terraform state list

# Show detailed state information
terraform state show <resource_name>

# Remove resource from state (without destroying)
terraform state rm <resource_name>

# Move resource to different state address
terraform state mv <source> <destination>

# Pull current state and display
terraform state pull
```

### Security Considerations

- **S3 Bucket Policy**: Restrict access to authorized users only
- **S3 Versioning**: Required for state locking; also provides rollback capability
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption for S3 bucket (server-side encryption)
- **Access Logging**: Enable CloudTrail for audit logging
- **IAM Permissions**: Grant minimal required S3 permissions (no DynamoDB permissions needed)

### Common Issues

- **State Lock Error**: If terraform process crashes, the lock file may remain. Manually delete it from S3 or use: `terraform force-unlock <lock-id>`
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper IAM permissions for S3 operations
- **Versioning Not Enabled**: S3 versioning MUST be enabled for native state locking to work
- **Region Mismatch**: Backend region should match your provider region
- **Bucket Names**: S3 bucket names must be globally unique
- **Terraform Version**: Requires Terraform 1.10+ for S3 native locking; 1.11+ recommended for stable GA release
