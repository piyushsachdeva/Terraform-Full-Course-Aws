### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned how important the Terraform state file is as the single source of truth that tracks real cloud resources and keeps Terraform in sync with your infrastructure. I also understood why using a secure remote backend like S3 with locking and versioning is critical to avoid corruption, enable team collaboration, and protect sensitive state data.
